# 🏠 House Pricing Prediction Hackathon

## 📌 Overview

When homebuyers describe their dream house, they often focus on aspects like the number of bedrooms or the presence of a garden. However, many hidden factors—such as basement height or proximity to a railway—also significantly influence the final sale price.

This hackathon challenges participants to predict house prices in **`Ames, Iowa`**, using a dataset containing 79 explanatory variables that describe various aspects of residential properties. It is an excellent opportunity for data science and machine learning enthusiasts to apply their skills and explore advanced regression techniques

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this hackathon is sourced from Kaggle, ensuring high-quality and real-world-representative data for analysis and modeling

## 🏆 Hackathon Goals

Participants will:

- ✅ Accurately predict house sale prices based on detailed property characteristics.
- ✅ Experiment with advanced machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
- ✅ Apply feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
- ✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, outliers, and key influencing factors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment
Before running the project, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2️⃣ Understanding the Files

- **requirements.txt**: Contains the list of required Python packages for the project
- **sample_submission.csv**: Oour final predictions for test.csv will be saved in this file.
- **notebook.ipynb** : details our final approach including : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),Feature Selection,Tested Models and Justifications, Final Predictions
